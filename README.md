CCP CompMedChem - Meeting Minutes (10/03/17)

- Executive Summary:

- A collective effort that would improve the ease-of-use and productivity of computational

- chemistry in compound discovery was discussed. In the morning, three core topics were

- discussed.​ 1) ​Is this a useful ambition and is there will in the room to proceed?​ 2)​ What are the

- short term (InnovateUK - deadline April 12th) and long term ambitions and what are people able

- to commit to? ​3)​ What are the actions and the timelines? In the afternoon we discussed the

- proposed technical setup in more detail and how CCP CompMedChem would fit into the

- framework of CCPs and STFC’s strategic goals.

- From the meeting it was agreed that ​1)​ CCP CompMedChem would be beneficial for all parties.

- 2) ​Industrial parties were willing to contribute in-kind to grant applications. Academic parties

- were willing to contribute time and resources in adopting the platform and generating tools for it.

- 3) ​The InnovateUK work packages should be made more focussed and core concerns around

- the application would be answered over the next week. Longer term - other research councils

- should be approached for funding for both core development activities and outreach/training.

- InnovateUK grant actions

- Agreed Actions:

- 1. Engage InnovateUK regarding concerns (see below) (by wednesday)

- 2. Rework work packages and re-present to partners (this week)

- 3. Complete InnovateUK filing (next two-three weeks)

a. Business case

b. Scientific scope (narrower and more precise)

- Work packages:

- Fragments a core focus - in four different areas with proposed partners

- 1. Compound design tool - Evotec, e-Therapeutics, ICR, CCDC and Cresset

- 2. Molecular standardisation / ​preparation ​ - UCB, ChEMBL, STFC (Mark Forster), CCDC

- 3. Evaluation / comparison of tools - GSK, CCDC and Cresset

a. Focus on blind prospective studies

- 4. Consolidation of studentships - GSK, UCB, Evotec, e-Therapeutics, CCDC

- Academic funding - to be discussed - depends on industrial input and work packages

- Preparedness to commit

- ● Industrial: ​Willing to commit in kind (timescale permitting)

- ● Academic: ​Willing to use framework and commit tools / resource to it

- Concerns:

- We will aim to have answers to the InnovateUK questions by end of Wednesday.

- 1. What is fundable?

a. Compounds

b. Studentships

c. Data

d. Software - code or licenses

Is novelty important?

- 2. Signed agreement necessary?

- 3.

- 4. Does data used need to be available?

- 5. Timescale of the auditing

- 6.

- Key issues for companies to consider?

Is European money l​everageable​? What is UK company?

- ● How will this grant improve your turnover?

- ● What in-kind material they can get hands on - and in what timescales?

- ● Are they able to apply auditing to such things simply?

- Companies to include:

- 1. Astex and Vernalis (fragments)

- 2. Syngenta (not just medicines)

- Longer term

- Actions:

- 1. Approach BBSRC / MRC / WT

- 2. Funding for meeting of CCP4 style annual meeting, workshops and outreach

- 3. Europe wide funding possibilities

- 4. Long-term sustainability proposals for maintaining core code

- Concerns:

- 1. Formal proposal for longevity of CCP CompMedChem

- 2. Specific technologies (e.g. Docker) - build prop

- 3. Open-source platform needed (not reliant on one person)

- All willing to commit irrelevant of success of InnovateUK grant

- Clarifications:

- ● What is the name?

○ CCP CompMedChem - may not be appropriate for agrochemicals - we willcontinue investigating other names.

- ● Is CCP CMC developing our own algorithms?

○ This wouldn’t be a core goal of CCP CompMedChem. Rather we would supportalgorithm developers to move their software into use.

- ● Why is this different to Knime/Pipeline pilot?

○ CCP CompMedChem is overall technology agnostic. Knime workflows arealready able to be submitted as SQUONK nodes. We will focus on any

technology that enables tools to be used and interoperated.

- ● Do we envisage Python / Java / Bash etc at core?

○ No. We aim to be as technology agnostic as possible. Containerisation

technologies allow for any software language / library to be used.

- ● What’s going to happen to platform code?

○ We will open-source the workflow tool as part of the InnovateUK funding. Thiswould become a community asset.

- ● What do you get if you put in money?

○ You get to design the projects - ensure they reach an unmet need for yourcompany.

○ You get first access to any software developed - as you have full access todevelopment code.

- ● How do we support more interactive tools (e.g. Ipython or SeeSAR)?

○ We aim for these to be part of the project further on.

- ● Can studentships be part of the contributions?

○ Yes - as part of InnovateUK at least.

- ● Isn’t Docker a major issue?

○ We recognise some concerns with Docker - although most of them are historical.We see it is the simplest way of performing the goal we wish to pursue. If othercontainerisation technologies are preferable - we are willing to pursue theminstead.

- ● What is are the KPIs of InnovateUK funding?

○ Creation of jobs is a must. Needs to have a clear impact on the bottom line of UKindustry.

-

hit triage / capturing molecular design ideas

- - Use within Med-chem groups

- -

- -

- - Enriching deposition and establishing the standard for quality

- - Mechanism for producing and maintaining datasets

Ligand validation - especially fragments

- Jason Cole - CCDC:

- - Potential to find commitment

- - Structure preparation / curation - they have test bed

- -

- - Rolling out tools even for CCDC an issue

Longevity / transferring of PhD projects to use

- Andrew Leach - ChEMBL:

Fragments a good business case

- -

- - Platform valuable

- - Not losing PhD projects

- - Off the shelf pipeline

- - Would want to contribute

- Ian Wall - GSK:

Like the project

12th April - tight deadline - level of commitment?

- -

- -

- - Ability to assess tools - lots of time currently spent doing this

- - Maintenance of open-source tools

- Paolo Tosco - Cresset:

- - Wider, easier and more productive tools

- - Difficult to use HPC

- -

- - Need to define competitive advantage and spell out very clearly

Too many tools and number of other workflows - where’s the novelty?
